VersusExtension
===============

Chrome extension that allows you to quickly compare number of Google results for multiple queries.

After installation, type "vs" into omnibox and provide couple of queries (comma separated):

Click 'Enter' and you'll get results page:

## Notes
This is just an experiment. Since there are no Google Search APIs that are both free and provide total number of results, this extension is scraping Google results page. If overused, Google may start throwing captchas at you.
